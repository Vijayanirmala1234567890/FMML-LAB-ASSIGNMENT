Both should be large enough and representative of the overall dataset to provide reliable estimates of model performance. Additionally, the choice of validation set size should consider the trade-offs between model learning and performance estimation. Techniques like k-fold cross-validation can also be used to mitigate the impact of validation set size and provide more robust estimates.\n",

It can provide a more robust estimate of model performance and mitigate the impact of the validation set size.\n",

The goal is to find the right balance that allows the model to generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",

        "Early Stopping: To prevent overfitting, practitioners often employ early stopping, which involves monitoring the validation performance during training and stopping the training process when the validation performance starts to degrade.

        "Limited Data Information:\n",

        "Alternative Strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than relying solely on increasing iterations, it's often more effective to consider other strategies, such as data augmentation (for image data), regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L1/L2 regularization), or using transfer learning (especially for deep learning) to leverage knowledge from larger datasets.\n",
